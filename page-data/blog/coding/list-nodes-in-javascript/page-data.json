At its simplest, a list node is an object that contains a value and a reference to the next node in a linked list. Linked lists are a type of data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers, with each node containing data and a reference to the next node in the list."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are many different types of list nodes, each with their own unique characteristics and use cases.
