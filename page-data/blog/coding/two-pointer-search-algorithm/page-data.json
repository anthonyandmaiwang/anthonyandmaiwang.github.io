We can use the 2 pointer algorithm to solve this problem. We start by initializing two pointers, one at the beginning of the array and one at the end of the array. We then check the sum of the two numbers pointed to by the two pointers. If the sum is equal to the target value, we have found our pair of numbers. If the sum is less than the target value, we move the left pointer to the right by one position. If the sum is greater than the target value, we move the right pointer to the left by one position. We repeat this process until we find a pair of numbers that sum up to the target value, or until the two pointers meet."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Applications of the 2 pointer algorithm"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The 2 pointer algorithm can be applied to solve a wide range of programming problems, including:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"ul","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Finding pairs of numbers that sum up to a certain target value in an array."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Checking whether an array is sorted or not."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Finding the intersection of two sorted arrays."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Removing duplicates from a sorted array."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Finding the maximum subarray sum in an array."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Detecting a cycle in a linked list."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Finding the middle element of a linked list."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Advantages of the 2 pointer algorithm"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The 2 pointer algorithm has several advantages over other algorithms.
